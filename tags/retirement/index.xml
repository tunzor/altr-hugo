Money here can either mean cash or investments of some kind and that&amp;rsquo;s where some of the confusion around them can arise. That opening sentence specifically uses &amp;ldquo;accounts that hold money&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;accounts that hold savings&amp;rdquo; because while both can be used to hold cash (like a regular savings account), when used to their potential they hold investments and provide a shelter from or deferral of taxes &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re tax-advantaged accounts.</description>
