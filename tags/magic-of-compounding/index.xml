      <description>Contents: Interest is a payment made to someone for the use of their money. You pay interest on loans you take out for the use of the lender’s money to buy something like property (mortgage) or education (student). Conversely, banks and other financial institutions will pay you interest on money you “loan” to them &amp;ndash; more commonly known as your savings account.
In both cases, the amount of money paid to either party is determined by the interest rate: a percentage of the total amount used to calculate the interest owed to the lender and payable by the borrower.</description>
