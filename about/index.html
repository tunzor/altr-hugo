<title>About | Adult Like the Rest</title>
<meta name="description" content="About What is Adult Like the Rest? Like the tagline says it&rsquo;s a blog about &ldquo;trying to help fill out the pages of the missing manual on being an adult&rdquo;.
There are a lot of topics not covered in school (or not covered enough) that are important to living life as an independent adult. Practical topics like how to cook, how to make a budget and stick to it, how to get and compare terms of a loan, as well as less practical but equally important topics like thinking critically about advice you receive and why you should ask a lot of questions.">

<h2 id="what-is-adult-like-the-rest">What is Adult Like the Rest?</h2>
<p>Like the tagline says it&rsquo;s a blog about &ldquo;trying to help fill out the pages of the missing manual on being an adult&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There are a lot of topics not covered in school (or not covered enough) that are important to living life as an independent adult. Practical topics like how to cook, how to make a budget and stick to it, how to get and compare terms of a loan, as well as less practical but equally important topics like thinking critically about advice you receive and why you should ask a lot of questions.</p>
<p>This aims to be a resource to help others understand these topics through experiences and research compiled by me.</p>
<p>You may be asking&hellip;</p>

<p><code>anthony (ann-thuh-nee)</code>:<br>
Canadian adult lacking any professional credentials that would qualify him to give advice - writing about stuff he&rsquo;s learned and hoping it&rsquo;s helpful to others.</p>
<p>I am <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>an accountant</li>
<li>a trained chef</li>
<li>an anthropologist</li>
<li>a psychologist</li>
<li>really all that interesting</li>
</ul>
<p>I am:</p>
<ul>
<li>just an adult</li>
</ul>
<p>All that to say: the posts on this blog are written from my experiences &ndash; the hope is that they&rsquo;re are informational and not prescriptive. I do what I can to provide useful information supported by external resources but any advice I give on this blog should be verified by you, the reader.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a guy who&rsquo;s figured out a few things about being an adult and would like to share those with you in the hope that it helps you figure out this thing called adulthood.</p>
